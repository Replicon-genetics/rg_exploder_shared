# rg_exploder_shared

Python code for generating synthetic sequence data; Synthetic DNASEQ or RNASEQ reads

This repository https://github.com/snowlizardz/rg_exploder_shared/ holds Python code, shell scripts, data and metadata for the fragmentation of DNA sequences intended to emulate NGS style sequencing reads. Further documents are also included eg: Maintenance guide for using the maintenance tools in folders helper_python & helper_scripts.

The main objective of the repository is to share this with selected people, or for placement the Public Domain as read-only when permissions are suitably set.

Terms: "We would like to offer this to you for free to use and modify (as you and your colleagues deem fit) for the  period {start date} to {end date}.  If you start to use it routinely in your bioinformatics pipeline then we ask you come back and tell us about it."

If this repository becomes a public-domain read-only repository, then the terms of use will be GNU Copyleft of some sort - TBD

The files in this repository are a subset taken from the development repository at https://github.com/snowlizardz/rg_exploder. 

The same Python code, data etc are behind a Vue.js implementation at https://repliconevaluation.wordpress.com/replicon-genetics. The source for building the Vue.js implementation is held at https://github.com/Replicon-genetics/rg_exploder, with a subset of critical definition files present in this repository: folders pyodide and webdist 

Code and documentation was developed between September 2018 to March 2025 by Cary O'Donnell, originally for Replicon Genetics, a company set up Dr Gillian Ellison and Jane Theaker in 2018. IP is claimed by them and Cary O'Donnell.
