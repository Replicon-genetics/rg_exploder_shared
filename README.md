# rg_exploder_shared
 
This repository https://github.com/snowlizardz/rg_exploder_shared/ holds Python code, shell scripts, data and metadata for the fragmentation of DNA sequences intended to emulate NGS-style sequencing reads. Further documents are also included eg: Maintenance guide for using the maintenance tools in folders helper_python & helper_scripts.

The main objective of the repository is to share this with members of "XXXX", specifically the team led by YYYYY under the terms: "We would like to offer this to you for free to use and modify (as you and your colleagues at the North West genomic laboratory hub deem fit) for the next {period} from {date}.  If you start to use it routinely in your bioinformatics pipeline then: a: we ask you come back and tell us about it; b: other XXXXX"

These files are a subset taken from the development repository at https://github.com/snowlizardz/rg_exploder. 

The same Python code, data etc are behind a Vue.js implementation at https://repliconevaluation.wordpress.com/replicon-genetics. The source for building the Vue.js implementation is held at https://github.com/Replicon-genetics/rg_exploder, with a subset of critical definition files present in this repository: folders pyodide and webdist 

Code and documentation was developed between September 2018 to February 2025 by Cary O'Donnell for Replicon Genetics, a company set up Dr Gillian Ellison and Jane Theaker in 2018. IP is claimed by them and Cary O'Donnell.
